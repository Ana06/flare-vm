# VirtualBox scripts

**This folder contains several scripts related to enhance building, exporting, and using FLARE-VM in VirtualBox.**


## Clean up snapshots

It is not possible to select and delete several snapshots in VirtualBox, making cleaning up your VM manually after having creating a lot snapshots time consuming and tedious (possible errors when deleting several snapshots simultaneously).

[`vbox-clean-snapshots.py`](vbox-clean-snapshots.py) cleans a VirtualBox VM up by deleting a snapshot and its children recursively skipping snapshots with a substring in the name.

### Example

```
$ ./vbox-remove-snapshots.py FLARE-VM.20240604

Cleaning FLARE-VM.20240604 ü´ß Snapshots to delete:
  Snapshot 1
  wip unpacked
  JS downloader deobfuscated 
  Snapshot 6
  C2 decoded
  Snapshot 5
  wip
  Snapshot 4
  Snapshot 3
  Snapshot 2
  complicated chain - all samples ready

VM state: Paused
‚ö†Ô∏è  Snapshot deleting is slower in a running VM and may fail in a changing state

Confirm deletion (press 'y'):y

Deleting... (this may take some time, go for an üç¶!)
  ü´ß DELETED 'Snapshot 1'
  ü´ß DELETED 'wip unpacked'
  ü´ß DELETED 'JS downloader deobfuscated '
  ü´ß DELETED 'Snapshot 6'
  ü´ß DELETED 'C2 decoded'
  ü´ß DELETED 'Snapshot 5'
  ü´ß DELETED 'wip'
  ü´ß DELETED 'Snapshot 4'
  ü´ß DELETED 'Snapshot 3'
  ü´ß DELETED 'Snapshot 2'
  ü´ß DELETED 'complicated chain - all samples ready'

See you next time you need to clean up your VMs! ‚ú®

## Check internet adapter status

[`vbox-adapter-check.py`](vbox-adapter-check.py) prints the status of all internet adapters of all VMs in VirtualBox.
The script also notifies if any dynamic analysis VM (with `.dynamic` in the name) has an adapter whose type is not allowed (internet access is undesirable for dynamic malware analysis).
Unless the argument `--do_not_modify` is provided, the script changes the type of the adapters with non-allowed type to Host-Only.
Unless the argument `--skip_disabled` is provided, the script also explores the disabled adapters, printing their status and possibly changing their type.
The script has been tested in Debian 12 with GNOME 44.9.

### Example

```
$ ./vbox-adapter-check.py
windows10 1: Enabled  HostOnly
windows10 2: Disabled Null
windows10 3: Disabled Null
windows10 4: Disabled Null
windows10 5: Disabled Null
windows10 6: Disabled Null
windows10 7: Disabled Null
windows10 8: Disabled Null
FLARE-VM.20240808.dynamic 1: Enabled  NAT
FLARE-VM.20240808.dynamic 2: Disabled NAT
FLARE-VM.20240808.dynamic 3: Disabled Bridged
FLARE-VM.20240808.dynamic 4: Enabled  Internal
FLARE-VM.20240808.dynamic 5: Disabled Null
FLARE-VM.20240808.dynamic 6: Disabled Null
FLARE-VM.20240808.dynamic 7: Disabled Null
FLARE-VM.20240808.dynamic 8: Disabled Null
```

#### Notification

## Export snapshot

[`vbox-export-snapshot.py`](vbox-export-snapshot.py) exports a VirtualBox snapshot as an Open Virtual Appliance (OVA) file.
The script configures the exported VM with a single Host-Only network interface, and the resulting OVA file is named after the snapshot.
A separate file containing the SHA256 hash of the OVA is also generated for verification.
The script accepts an optional description for the OVA and the name of the export directory within the user's home directory (`$HOME`) where the OVA and SHA256 hash file will be saved.
If no export directory is provided, the default directory name is `EXPORTED VMS`.

### Example

```
$ ./vbox-export-snapshots.py "FLARE-VM.testing" "FLARE-VM" --description "Windows 10 VM with FLARE-VM default configuration"

Exporting snapshot "FLARE-VM" from "FLARE-VM.testing" {2bc66f50-9ecb-4b10-a4dd-0cc329bc383d}...

```

## Build FLARE-VM

[`vbox-build-flare-vm.py`](vbox-build-flare-vm.py) automates the creation and export of customized FLARE-VM virtual machines (VMs).
The script begins by restoring a pre-existing `BUILD-READY` snapshot of a clean Windows installation.
The script then copies the required installation files (such as the IDA Pro installer, FLARE-VM configuration, and legal notices) into the guest VM.
After installing FLARE-VM, a `base` snapshot is taken.
This snapshot serves as the foundation for generating subsequent snapshots and exporting OVA images, all based on the configuration provided in a YAML file.
This configuration file specifies the VM name, the exported VM name, and details for each snapshot.
Individual snapshot configurations can include custom commands to be executed within the guest, legal notices to be applied, and file/folder exclusions for the automated cleanup process.
See configuration example files in the [`configs`](configs/) directory.

The `BUILD-READY` snapshot is expected to be an empty Windows installation that satisfies the FLARE-VM installation requirements and has UAC disabled
To disable UAC execute in a cmd console with admin rights and restart the VM for the change to take effect:
```
%windir%\System32\reg.exe ADD HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System /v EnableLUA /t REG_DWORD /d 0 /f
```
