# VirtualBox scripts

**This folder contains several scripts related to enhance building, exporting, and using FLARE-VM in VirtualBox.**


## Clean up snapshots

It is not possible to select and delete several snapshots in VirtualBox, making cleaning up your VM manually after having creating a lot snapshots time consuming and tedious (possible errors when deleting several snapshots simultaneously).

[`vbox-clean-snapshots.py`](vbox-clean-snapshots.py) cleans a VirtualBox VM up by deleting a snapshot and its children recursively skipping snapshots with a substring in the name.

### Example

```
$ ./vbox-remove-snapshots.py FLARE-VM.20240604

Cleaning FLARE-VM.20240604 ü´ß Snapshots to delete:
  Snapshot 1
  wip unpacked
  JS downloader deobfuscated 
  Snapshot 6
  C2 decoded
  Snapshot 5
  wip
  Snapshot 4
  Snapshot 3
  Snapshot 2
  complicated chain - all samples ready

VM state: Paused
‚ö†Ô∏è  Snapshot deleting is slower in a running VM and may fail in a changing state

Confirm deletion (press 'y'):y

Deleting... (this may take some time, go for an üç¶!)
  ü´ß DELETED 'Snapshot 1'
  ü´ß DELETED 'wip unpacked'
  ü´ß DELETED 'JS downloader deobfuscated '
  ü´ß DELETED 'Snapshot 6'
  ü´ß DELETED 'C2 decoded'
  ü´ß DELETED 'Snapshot 5'
  ü´ß DELETED 'wip'
  ü´ß DELETED 'Snapshot 4'
  ü´ß DELETED 'Snapshot 3'
  ü´ß DELETED 'Snapshot 2'
  ü´ß DELETED 'complicated chain - all samples ready'

See you next time you need to clean up your VMs! ‚ú®

## Check internet adapter status

[`vbox-adapter-check.py`](vbox-adapter-check.py) prints the status of all internet adapters of all VMs in VirtualBox.
The script also notifies if any dynamic analysis VM (with `.dynamic` in the name) has an adapter whose type is not allowed (internet access is undesirable for dynamic malware analysis).
Unless the argument `--do_not_modify` is provided, the script changes the type of the adapters with non-allowed type to Host-Only.
Unless the argument `--skip_disabled` is provided, the script also explores the disabled adapters, printing their status and possibly changing their type.
The script has been tested in Debian 12 with GNOME 44.9.

### Example

```
$ ./vbox-adapter-check.py
windows10 1: Enabled  HostOnly
windows10 2: Disabled Null
windows10 3: Disabled Null
windows10 4: Disabled Null
windows10 5: Disabled Null
windows10 6: Disabled Null
windows10 7: Disabled Null
windows10 8: Disabled Null
FLARE-VM.20240808.dynamic 1: Enabled  NAT
FLARE-VM.20240808.dynamic 2: Disabled NAT
FLARE-VM.20240808.dynamic 3: Disabled Bridged
FLARE-VM.20240808.dynamic 4: Enabled  Internal
FLARE-VM.20240808.dynamic 5: Disabled Null
FLARE-VM.20240808.dynamic 6: Disabled Null
FLARE-VM.20240808.dynamic 7: Disabled Null
FLARE-VM.20240808.dynamic 8: Disabled Null
```

#### Notification

## Export snapshots

[`vbox-export-snapshots.py`](vbox-export-snapshots.py) export one or more snapshots in the same VirtualBox VM as .ova, changing the network to a single Host-Only interface.
It also generates a file with the SHA256 hash of the exported `.ova`.
This script is useful to export several versions of FLARE-VM after its installation consistently and with the internet disabled by default (desired for malware analysis).
For example, you may want to export a VM with the default FLARE-VM configuration and another installing in addition the packages `visualstudio.vm` and `pdbs.pdbresym.vm`.
These packages are useful for malware analysis but are not included in the default configuration because of the consequent increase in size.
The scripts receives the path of the JSON configuration file as argument.
See configuration example files in the [`configs`](configs/) directory.

### Example

$ ./vbox-export-snapshots.py configs/export_win10_flare-vm.json

## Build FLARE-VM

[`vbox-build-flare-vm.py`](vbox-build-flare-vm.py) prepares a VirtualBox VM for building FLARE-VM.
