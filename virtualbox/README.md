# Clean up snapshots

Its is not possible to select and delete several snapshots in VirtualBox, making cleaning up your virtual machine (VM) manually after having creating a lot snapshots time consuming and tedious (possible errors when deleting several snapshots simultaneously).

[`vbox-remove-snapshots.py`](vbox-remove-snapshots.py) cleans a VirtualBox VM up by deleting a snapshots and its children recursively skipping snapshots with a substring in the name.

## Example

```
$ python3 vbox-remove-snapshots.py FLARE-VM.20240604

Cleaning FLARE-VM.20240604 🫧 Snapshots to delete:
  Snapshot 1
  wip unpacked
  JS downloader deobfuscated 
  Snapshot 6
  C2 decoded
  Snapshot 5
  wip
  Snapshot 4
  Snapshot 3
  Snapshot 2
  complicated chain - all samples ready

Confirm deletion ('y'):y
Deleting... (this might take some time, go for an 🍦!)
